  abstract = {Abstract             The tropical glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, are rapidly retreating, resulting in complex impacts on the hydrology of the upper R\'io Santa watershed. The effect of this retreat on water resources is evaluated by analyzing historical and recent time series of daily discharge at nine measurement points. Using the Mann-Kendall nonparametric statistical test, the significance of trends in three hydrograph parameters was studied. Results are interpreted using synthetic time series generated from a hydrologic model that calculates hydrographs based on glacier retreat sequences. The results suggest that seven of the nine study watersheds have probably crossed a critical transition point, and now exhibit decreasing dry-season discharge. Our results suggest also that once the glaciers completely melt, annual discharge will be lower than present by 2-30\% depending on the watershed. The retreat influence on discharge will be more pronounced during the dry season than at other periods of the year. At La Balsa, which measures discharge from the upper R\'io Santa, the glacier retreat could lead to a decrease in dry-season average discharge of 30\%.},

  abstract = {The rapid retreat of the glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca is having a noticeable impact on the downstream hydrology. Although groundwater is a critical hydrologic component that sustains stream flows during the dry season, its characteristics and its contribution to downstream hydrology remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyse the hydrochemical and isotopic properties of potential hydrologic sources mixing in surface streams to characterize the proglacial hydrology in four glacially fed watersheds within the Cordillera Blanca, Peru. Water samples from streams, glacial melt and groundwater were collected in 2008 and 2009 and analysed for major ions and stable isotopes ({$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}2H). Multivariate analysis of variance was used first to identify the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics (tracers) of the water samples that depend primarily on the water source. Then several analyses, including hierarchical cluster analysis and mixing diagrams, were performed using these sourcedependent tracers, enabling a qualitative description of the key hydrological mechanisms that characterize the study watersheds. Finally, we applied a multi-component spatial mixing model, the hydrochemical basin characterization method, to quantify the contributions of different water sources to the outflow from the four watersheds. The hydrochemical basin characterization method results show that groundwater is a major component of the discharge during the dry season and that the groundwater contribution to outflow is greater than 24\% in all of the valleys. The results are used to develop a conceptual proglacial hydrological model of the Cordillera Blanca valleys. Talus and avalanche cones are identified as key components of the hydrology of the valleys. The talus deposits collect precipitation and runoff from higher elevations (approximately 400 m above the valley floor) and have a residence time that is long enough to actively release substantial volumes of water throughout the dry season.

Fog was measured with a cylindrical Juvik gauge and types of precipitation other than fog with a high-resolution disdrometer. Soil moisture was measured at 100 mm depth by means of Water Content Reflectometers, then Effective precipitation (EP) was calculated. We categorized events as two types: fog only (FO) and cloud water (CW). We found that in the case of FO events, only small amounts reached the soil (EP ranged between 0.1 and 0.2 mm); in contrast, greater amounts of EP originated from CW events (maximum value of 4.3 mm). Although we found that FO events are negligible for stream water contribution; they are ecologically important for maintaining high relative humidity, low net radiation, and consequently low evapotranspiration rates. Our research provides new insights into the hydrological role of fog, enabling us to better understand to what extent its input influences the water resources of the Andean p\'aramo.},

In addition to the societal benefits of predicting natural hazards, our study reveals a linkage between polar and tropical regimes as the responsible mechanism: the interplay of northward migrating frontal systems and a low-level wind channel from the western Amazon to the subtropics.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Glacier melt is an important source of water for high Andean rivers in central Chile, especially in dry years, when it can be an important contributor to flows during late summer and autumn. However, few studies have quantified glacier melt contribution to streamflow in this region. To address this shortcoming, we present an analysis of meteorological conditions and ablation for Universidad Glacier, one of the largest valley glaciers in the central Andes of Chile at the head of the Tinguiririca River, for the 2009\textendash 2010 ablation season. We used meteorological measurements from two automatic weather stations installed on the glacier to drive a distributed temperature-index and runoff routing model. The temperature-index model was calibrated at the lower weather station site and showed good agreement with melt estimates from an ablation stake and sonic ranger, and with a physically based energy balance model. Total modelled glacier melt is compared with river flow measurements at three sites located between 0.5 and 50\,km downstream. Universidad Glacier shows extremely high melt rates over the ablation season which may exceed 10\,m water equivalent in the lower ablation area, representing between 10 and 13\,\% of the mean monthly streamflow at the outlet of the Tinguiririca River Basin between December~2009 and March~2010. This contribution rises to a monthly maximum of almost 20\,\% in March~2010, demonstrating the importance of glacier runoff to streamflow, particularly in dry years such as 2009\textendash 2010. The temperature-index approach benefits from the availability of on-glacier meteorological data, enabling the calculation of the local hourly variable lapse rate, and is suited to high melt regimes, but would not be easily applicable to glaciers further north in Chile where sublimation is more significant.},

  abstract = {Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic evidence provides ample indication that water was a key symbol in Andean thought. During the late precolumbian era, the attention lavished on waterworks and features by the Inca emphasizes a clear concern with control over water and its movement. This paper examines the way in which specific relations of power and identity were constructed through Inca management of water. To this end, I offer a comparative analysis of water-related features from different sectors of the Empire, representing different moments in its historical development. The intent is to further our understanding of how the manipulation of water figured in the imperializing process and how its use and meaning may have evolved over time. The architectural evidence from the sites included in the study suggests that conspicuous exercise of control over the movement and flow of water may have been more critical to the establishment of Inca hegemony than to its subsequent maintenance.           ,              Evidencias arqueol\'ogicas, etnohist\'oricas, y etnogr\'aficas proporcionan amplias indicaciones de que el agua fue un s\'imbolo clave en el pensamiento andino.

Many of the largest tributaries of the Amazon basin have their headwaters in the p\'aramo. It is also the major water source for the Andean highlands and a vast area of arid and semi-arid lowlands, where p\'aramo water is used for domestic, agricultural and industrial consumption, and the generation of hydropower. Recently, the p\'aramo is increasingly used for intensive cattle grazing, cultivation, and pine planting, among others. These activities, as well as global phenomena such as climate change, severely alter the hydrological regime. A review on the state of knowledge of its hydrology is given in a first part. In a second part, the impact of human activities and climate change on the hydrology of the p\'aramo is discussed.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, the Andean highlands of Ecuador have been characterised by intense afforestation efforts, in order to increase the economic return of less viable agricultural areas, reduce erosion and, more recently, to sequestrate atmospheric carbon. Afforestation with Pinus species is widespread in the high altitudinal grasslands known as pa\textasciiacute ramos. The impact of Pinus patula afforestation on the water yield is studied and compared to the more common practice of intensive grazing and potato cultivation in four microcatchments in the Paute river basin in south Ecuador. Two catchments are covered with natural grassland vegetation, one is converted to pine forest, and one is drained, partly intensively grazed, and partly cultivated with potatoes. The results indicate that afforestation with P. patula reduces the water yield by about 50\%, or an average of 242 mm year\`A1. The water yield of the cultivated catchment is very similar to that of the natural catchments, but analysis of the flow duration curves suggests a faster response and a loss of base flow. These effects may have important implications for a sustainable management of the pa\textasciiacute ramo ecosystem, given that the pa\textasciiacute ramo is the major water supplier for the Andean highlands.},

  abstract = {Accelerated melting of glaciers is expected to have a negative effect on the water resources of mountain regions and their adjacent lowlands, with tropical mountain regions being among the most vulnerable. In order to quantify those impacts, it is necessary to understand the changing dynamics of glacial melting, but also to map how glacial meltwater contributes to current and future water use, which often occurs at considerable distance downstream of the terminus of the glacier. While the dynamics of tropical glacial melt are increasingly well understood and documented, major uncertainty remains on how the contribution of tropical glacial meltwater propagates through the hydrological system, and hence how it contributes to various types of human water use in downstream regions. Therefore, in this paper we present a detailed regional mapping of current water demand in regions downstream of the major tropical glaciers. We combine these maps with a regional water balance model to determine the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of the contribution of glacial meltwater to human water use at an unprecedented scale and resolution. We find that the number of users relying continuously on water resources with a high ({$>$}25\%) long-term average contribution from glacial melt is low (391 000 domestic users, 398 km2 of irrigated land, and 11 MW of hydropower production), but this reliance increases sharply during drought conditions (up to 3.92 million domestic users, 2096 km2 of irrigated land, and 732 MW of hydropower production in the driest month of a drought year). A large proportion of domestic and agricultural users are located in rural regions where climate adaptation capacity tends to be low. Therefore, we suggest that adaptation strategies should focus on increasing the natural and artificial water storage and regulation capacity to bridge dry periods.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Worldwide, the rapid shrinking of glaciers in response to ongoing climate change is modifying the glacial meltwater contribution to hydrosystems in glacierized catchments. Determining the influence of glacial runoff to streams is therefore of critical importance to evaluate potential impact of glacier retreat on water quality and aquatic biota. This task has challenged both glacier hydrologists and ecologists over the last 20 yr due to both structural and functional complexity of the glacier\textendash stream system interface. Here we propose quantifying the diurnal cycle amplitude of the streamflow to determine the glacial influence in glacierized catchments. We performed water-level measurements using water pressure loggers over 10 months at 30 min time steps in 15 stream sites in 2 glacier-fed catchments in the Ecuadorian Andes ({$>$} 4000 m a.s.l.) where no perennial snow cover is observed outside the glaciers. For each stream site, we performed wavelet analyses on water-level time series, determined the scale-averaged wavelet power spectrum at 24 h scale and defined three metrics, namely the power, frequency and temporal clustering of the diurnal flow variation. The three metrics were then compared to the percentage of the glacier cover in the catchments, a metric of glacial influence widely used in the literature. As expected, we found that the diurnal variation power of glacier-fed streams decreased downstream with the addition of non-glacial tributaries. We also found that the diurnal variation power and the percentage of the glacier cover in the catchment were significantly positively correlated. Furthermore, we found that our method permits the detection of glacial signal in supposedly non-glacial sites, thereby revealing glacial meltwater resurgence. While we specifically focused on the tropical Andes in this paper, our approach to determine glacial influence may have potential applications in temperate and arctic glacierized catchments. The measure of diurnal water amplitude therefore appears as a powerful and cost-effective tool to understand the hydrological links between glaciers and hydrosystems better and assess the consequences of rapid glacier shrinking.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of catchment's water provenance and flow paths varies in space and time, complicating the conceptualization of the rainfall-runoff responses. We assessed the temporal dynamics in source areas, flow paths, and age by End Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA), hydrograph separation, and Inverse Transit Time Proxies (ITTPs) estimation within a headwater catchment in the Ecuadorian Andes. Twenty-two solutes, stable isotopes, pH, and electrical conductivity from a stream and 12 potential sources were analyzed. Four end-members were required to satisfactorily represent the hydrological system, i.e., rainfall, spring water, and water from the bottom layers of Histosols and Andosols. Water from Histosols in and near the riparian zone was the highest source contributor to runoff throughout the year (39\% for the drier season, 45\% for the wetter season), highlighting the importance of the water that is stored in the riparian zone. Spring water contributions to streamflow tripled during the drier season, as evidenced by geochemical signatures that are consistent with deeper flow paths rather than shallow interflow through Andosols. Rainfall exhibited low seasonal variation in this contribution. Hydrograph separation revealed that 94\% and 84\% is preevent water in the drier and wetter seasons, respectively. From low-flow to high-flow conditions, all the sources increased their contribution except spring water. The relative age of stream water decreased during wetter periods, when the contributing area of the riparian zone expands. The multimethod and multitracer approach enabled to closely study the interchanging importance of flow processes and water source dynamics from an interannual perspective.},

  abstract = {We used End-Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA) to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of source water contributions to streamflow generation from three headwater catchments that span a precipitation and ecosystem type gradient across \$1500 m elevation in the Colorado Front Range, USA. We additionally characterized the magnitude and type (rain versus snow) of precipitation and the resulting hydrologic response of surface and subsurface waters to this precipitation variability. The three catchments were representative of the montane rain-snow transition zone (snow was 39\% of total precipitation; r (standard deviation) = 10\%), the subalpine zone (69\% snow; r = 5\%), and the alpine zone (84\% snow; r = 10\%). All three catchments were identified as three end-member systems with their respective source waters being groundwater, snow precipitation or melt, rain (montane and subalpine only), and subsurface water from talus slopes (alpine only). Mean annual groundwater contributions were greater in forested catchments (28\%; r = 6\% in the montane, 31\%; r = 8\% in the subalpine) than in the alpine (19\%; r = 5\%) catchment. Snow-derived water contributions to streamflow were inversely related to groundwater and increased with elevation from 46\% (r = 15\%) in the montane zone to 58\% (r = 12\%) in the subalpine and 61\% (r = 7\%) in the alpine. Rain was 27\% (r = 8\%) of discharge in the montane and 11\% (r = 4\%) in the subalpine, while talus waters made up the final 21\% (r = 12\%) of streamflow in the alpine. Our results suggest that subsurface source waters (i.e. groundwater and talus water) that are influenced by the timing, magnitude, and type of recharge and by the storage capabilities of the subsurface may be the most sensitive to climate variability at higher elevations. In contrast, the proportion of rain versus snow was the primary control on source water variability at lower elevations.},

The research results revealed that pine plantations produce a decrease of annual water yield as a consequence of increased evapotranspiration. On the other hand, livestock grazing does not seem to affect the hydrological response, primarily due to the low animal density. The main impact of cultivation is the reduction in the regulating function of the catchment, with a large increase in the magnitude of peak flows and a reduction of base flows. Furthermore, research results revealed that vertical infiltration through the soil is dominant under wet conditions, whereas preferential flow within the organic horizon to the underlying mineral horizon is dominant during low intensity rains. Saturated excess surface flow is observed only during long rain events; otherwise near surface lateral flow in the organic layer occurs. There is no evidence of Hortonian flow.},

Their unique vegetation and soil characteristics, in combination with low temperature and abundant precipitation, create the most advantageous conditions for regulating and storing surface and groundwater. However, increasing temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation due to greenhouse-gas-emission climate change are threatening these fragile environments. In this study, we used regional observations and downscaled data for precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature during the reference period 1960\textendash 1990 and simulations for the future period 2041\textendash 2060 to study the present and future extents of paramo ecosystems in the Chingaza National Park (CNP), nearby Colombia's capital city, Bogot\'a. The historical data were used for establishing upper and lower precipitation and temperature boundaries to determine the locations where paramo ecosystems currently thrive. Our results found that increasing mean monthly temperatures and changing precipitation will render 39 to 52\% of the current paramo extent in CNP unsuitable for these ecosystems during the dry season, and 13 to 34\% during the wet season. The greatest loss of paramo area will occur during the dry season and for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5, when both temperature and precipitation boundaries are more prone to be exceeded. Although our initial estimates show the future impact on paramos and the water security of Bogot\'a due to climate change, complex internal and external interactions in paramo ecosystems make it essential to study other influencing climatic parameters (e.g., soil, topography, wind, etc.) apart from temperature and precipitation.},

The establishment of pine plantations for carbon sequestration and wood production has recently raised questions concerning the possible impact on the p\'aramo's ES. This study identifies the main stakeholders in this field and compares and contrasts their perceptions of the impact of pine plantations on the p\'aramo's ES, because the disparity among stakeholders' perceptions must be addressed to achieve sustainable management. The data were gathered using 56 semi-structured interviews and were qualitatively analyzed. The results show that the main stakeholder groups (landowners, local government officials, foresters, and nature conservationists) acknowledge the important ES of the plantations. The perception of plantation impact varies among and within stakeholder groups, however, on specific functions, such as water provision, carbon storage, erosion prevention, and habitat function for wildlife and natural vegetation. Consideration and integration of these perceptions can help policy makers and organizations develop sustainable policies for the future management of the p\'aramo ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The closure problem of representing hydrological boundary fluxes given the state of the system has been described as the scientific `Holy Grail' of hydrology. This relationship between storage state and flux should be hysteretic and scale dependent because of the differences between velocities and celerities in a hydrological system\textemdash effectively velocities are storage controlled, and celerities are controlled by storage deficits. To improve our understanding of the nature of these relationships a new hydrology model is used (the Multiple Interacting Pathways or MIPs model) to explore the influence of catchment scale on storage\textendash flow\textendash transport relationships, and their non-linearities. The MIPs model has been shown to produce acceptable simulations of both flow and tracer, i.e. of both celerities and velocities, at the G\aa rdsj\"on catchment in Sweden. In this study the model is used to simulate scaled versions of the G\aa rdsj\"on catchment to allow us for the first time to investigate the influence of scale on the non-linearities in storage\textendash flow\textendash transport relationships, and help us steer the quest for the scientific hydrological `Holy Grail'. The simulations reveal the influence of scale on flow response in the nature of storage\textendash discharge hysteresis and its links with antecedent storage; fractal-like systematic change of mean output travel times with scale; the effect of scale on input, output and storage residence time distributions; hysteric relations between storage and output travel times and links between storage and water table level hysteresis. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {Due to rising energy demands and abundant untapped potential, hydropower projects are rapidly increasing in the Neotropics. This is especially true in the wet and rugged Andean Amazon, where regional governments are prioritizing new hydroelectric dams as the centerpiece of long-term energy plans. However, the current planning for hydropower lacks adequate regional and basin-scale assessment of potential ecological impacts. This lack of strategic planning is particularly problematic given the intimate link between the Andes and Amazonian flood plain, together one of the most species rich zones on Earth. We examined the potential ecological impacts, in terms of river connectivity and forest loss, of the planned proliferation of hydroelectric dams across all Andean tributaries of the Amazon River. Considering data on the full portfolios of existing and planned dams, along with data on roads and transmission line systems, we developed a new conceptual framework to estimate the relative impacts of all planned dams. There are plans for 151 new dams greater than 2 MW over the next 20 years, more than a 300\% increase. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Our ecological impact analysis classified 47\% of the potential new dams as high impact and just 19\% as low impact. Sixty percent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. More than 80\% would drive deforestation due to new roads, transmission lines, or inundation. We conclude with a discussion of three major policy implications of these findings. 1) There is a critical need for further strategic regional and basin scale evaluation of dams. 2) There is an urgent need for a strategic plan to maintain Andes-Amazon connectivity. 3) Reconsideration of hydropower as a low-impact energy source in the Neotropics.},

The hydrological processes of these wetlands are not well understood within the larger hydrological system, impeding efforts to mitigate the rapid environmental changes anticipated due to regional population growth and climate change. This study constructed and calibrated a Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) system model for ecosystems with sparse data in the Quiroz-Chipillico watershed in the Piura region of Peru. The model simulates the impacts of possible changes within the hydrological system to assist decision-makers in strategizing about sustainable development for the region, especially the p\'aramo. Using scenarios designed with stakeholder participation, the WEAP model for the Quiroz-Chipillico watershed examines river headflow production, reservoir water levels, and demand coverage for downstream users when the upstream p\'aramo and its environs are subjected to changes of temperature, precipitation, and land use. The model reveals that while temperature and precipitation changes can be expected to impact p\'aramo water production, the anticipated land use changes will be a primary driver of hydrological responses in the p\'aramo and subsequent changes downstream.},

  abstract = {Peruvian glaciers are important contributors to dry season runoff for agriculture and hydropower, but they are at risk of disappearing due to climate change. We applied a physically based, energy balance melt model at five on-glacier sites within the Peruvian Cordilleras Blanca and Vilcanota. Net shortwave radiation dominates the energy balance, and despite this flux being higher in the dry season, melt rates are lower due to losses from net longwave radiation and the latent heat flux. The sensible heat flux is a relatively small contributor to melt energy. At three of the sites the wet season snowpack was discontinuous, forming and melting within a daily to weekly timescale, and resulting in highly variable melt rates closely related to precipitation dynamics. Cold air temperatures due to a strong La Ni\~na year at Shallap Glacier (Cordillera Blanca) resulted in a continuous wet season snowpack, significantly reducing wet season ablation. Sublimation was most important at the highest site in the accumulation zone of the Quelccaya Ice Cap (Cordillera Vilcanota), accounting for 81\% of ablation, compared to 2\%\textendash 4\% for the other sites. Air temperature and precipitation inputs were perturbed to investigate the climate sensitivity of the five glaciers. At the lower sites warmer air temperatures resulted in a switch from snowfall to rain, so that ablation was increased via the decrease in albedo and increase in net shortwave radiation. At the top of Quelccaya Ice Cap warming caused melting to replace sublimation so that ablation increased nonlinearly with air temperature.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Quantitative assessment of glacier contribution to present-day streamflow is a prerequisite to the anticipation of climate change impact on water resources in the Dry Andes. In this paper we focus on two glaciated headwater catchments of the Huasco Basin (Chile, 29\textdegree{} S). The combination of glacier monitoring data for five glaciers (Toro 1, Toro 2, Esperanza, Guanaco, Estrecho and Ortigas) with five automatic streamflow records at sites with glacier coverage of 0.4 to 11 \% allows the estimation of the mean annual glacier contribution to discharge between 2003/2004 and 2007/2008 hydrological years. In addition, direct manual measurements of glacier runoff were conducted in summer at the snouts of four glaciers, which provide the instantaneous contribution of glacier meltwater to stream runoff during summer. The results show that the mean annual glacier contribution to streamflow ranges between 3.3 and 23 \%, which is greater than the glaciated fraction of the catchments. We argue that glacier contribution is partly enhanced by the effect of snowdrift from the non-glacier area to the glacier surface. Glacier mass loss is evident over the study period, with a mean of -0.84 m w.e. yr-1 for the period 2003/2004\textendash 2007/2008, and also contributes to increase glacier runoff. An El Ni\~no episode in 2002 resulted in high snow accumulation, modifying the hydrological regime and probably reducing the glacier contribution in favor of seasonal snowmelt during the subsequent 2002/2003 hydrological year. At the hourly timescale, summertime glacier contributions are highly variable in space and time, revealing large differences in effective melting rates between glaciers and glacierets (from 1 mm w.e. h-1 to 6 mm w.e. h-1).},

The arrival of Chinesefunded projects in the region has altered a context traditionally dominated by multilateral development banks. Tensions are escalating around new dam projects and the environmental impact assessment process is increasingly the site of politicization around water in the region. In this perspective, we examine the most recent surge in dam development in South America, the resulting environmental and social impacts, and the mobilization of civil society and environmental groups that have developed in response to these projects. In the absence of regionally shared standards for environmental assessment and regional mechanisms to mitigate the emerging conflicts\textemdash primarily occurring between companies, states, and civil society\textemdash we argue there is a risk of a race to the bottom to finance infrastructure projects with laxer environmental and social standards.},

  abstract = {Tropical glaciers supply approximately half of dry-season stream discharge in glacierized valleys of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru. The remainder of streamflow originates as groundwater stored in alpine meadows and other proglacial geomorphic features. A better understanding of the hydrogeology of alpine groundwater, including sources, storage zones, and the locations and magnitudes of contributions to streamflow, is important for making accurate estimates of glacial inputs to the hydrologic budget, and for our ability to make predictions about future water resources as glaciers retreat. This field study focuses on two high-elevation meadows in valleys of the Cordillera Blanca, in headwaters and mid-valley locations. Tracer measurements of stream and spring discharge and groundwater-surface water exchange were combined with synoptic sampling of water isotopic and geochemical composition in order to characterize and quantify contributions to streamflow from different groundwater reservoirs. At the headwaters site, groundwater supplied approximately half of stream discharge from a small meadow, with most originating in an alluvial fan adjacent to the meadow and little (6\%) from the meadow itself; however, at the mid-valley site, where meadows are extensive, local groundwater has a large impact on streamflow and chemistry through large net contributions to discharge and turnover of surface water due to gross exchanges with groundwater. At the mid-valley site, stream discharge increased by 200 L s\`A1 (18\% of average discharge) over 1.2 km as it descended a moraine between two meadows. Such valley-crossing moraines, which create significant steps in the down-valley slope, are likely locations of substantial groundwater contribution to streams.},

  abstract = {The runoff from blanket peatland catchments tends to be dominated by flashy stormflows. However, it is not known whether changes in vegetation cover influence the nature of stormflow hydrographs from blanket peatlands. This is important since degraded peatlands are of concern to restoration bodies who seek to understand the wider impacts of restoration investment on ecosystem services. This paper tests the hypothesis that peak flows are significantly higher and lag times shorter at the catchment scale when blanket peat vegetation cover is reduced. Storm hydrograph data from the 1950s to the present day are analysed from a blanket peat catchment in northern England. The proportion of the catchment that was vegetated appears to have declined between the early 1950s and mid 1970s and then increased again to the present day. The changes in the proportion of bare peat over the catchment are coincident with changes in storm hydrographs. Hydrographs were significantly peakier with higher peaks per unit of rainfall (0.40 m3 mm\`A1 compared with 0.27 m3 mm\`A1) and narrower hydrograph shapes during the more eroded periods in the catchment and less so as the site has revegetated. Mean peak storm discharge was also significantly higher during the most eroded period. Thus, for the first time we have found evidence in a blanket peat headwater catchment that vegetation cover influences river flow response to rainfall.},

  abstract = {The paramo is a high mountain ecosystem with cold and humid climate, it has high amount of sunlight and cloudiness, furthermore, organic matter has low decomposition rates, hence, leaf litter degradation gets 40\% per year as maximum. In the last 70 years, the air temperature near the surface of the Tropical Andes has increased significantly up to 0.34 \textdegree C/decade. In the same region, it is estimated that in this century the average temperature will vary from {$<$}+ 1.60 \textdegree C to {$>$}+ 2.61 \textdegree C, which exceeds the threshold of natural climatic variability. On the other hand, although precipitation along the Andes has not shown an increase or diminish pattern between 1955 and 1994, it is projected that by the year 2100, it will decrease in the outer tropics and will increase in the interior tropics. In this paper, we discuss how the decomposition of organic matter in paramo areas is influenced by climate change and analyze how current trends of variation in temperature are projected to affect ecosystem processes. Previous studies have determined that the increase of the atmospheric temperature (as long as the humidity remains stable or increases), generates higher decomposition rates, so that an increase of 1 \textdegree C in the atmospheric temperature would also mean an increase in the rate of decomposition of up to 10\%. These changes would cause the release of the carbon accumulated in the soil to the atmosphere as CO2, which would be a determining factor for climate change.},

People have intentionally altered the fluvial system by damming rivers at a few strategic locations, and more widely by withdrawing surface water, primarily for irrigation. Unintended changes brought about by human activities are even more widespread and include forest clearance, agriculture, grazing, road construction, and urbanization, which increase rates of rainfall runoff and accelerate processes of water erosion. Some excavations deliver more sediment to river channels by destabilizing slopes and triggering processes of mass-movement.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Runoff from catchments with partial glacier cover is an integrated process of glacier melt, snowmelt, and surface and subsurface runoff of meltwater and rain from glacierized and non-glacierized areas. Additionally, inherent characteristics of the tropical Andes such as large meteorological variability, high elevation and steep slopes, hydrological effects of wetlands and lakes, and rapid glacier retreat make it difficult to model glacio-hydrological responses under changing climate. In this study, we developed a semi-distributed conceptual model applicable to partially glacierized catchments in the tropical Andes that considers all of these aspects, and we applied the model to the Huayna Potosi West headwater catchment in the Cordillera Real, Bolivia. Based on the latest 2 yr dataset of meteorological and hydrological monitoring, we showed the spatial and temporal variability of air temperature and precipitation in the region, and the dataset was used to calibrate model parameters and validate the performance of the daily runoff simulation. Variations in the simulated streamflow agreed well with the observed seasonal and temporal variations, and the result also showed that uncertainty pertaining to the spatial and temporal variations in air temperature and precipitation as well as the retarding effect of a wetland and lake strongly affected the runoff hydrograph. The simulated runoff components indicated that runoff from glacier melt occurs mainly in the initial period of the wet season, from October to early December, and in the late period of the wet season, March and April, although the runoff is relatively small in the latter period. Between these two periods in the wet season, major runoff components were estimated to be subsurface runoff in the non-glacierized area and surface runoff due to snowmelt. Given the future meteorological conditions based on the observational data and a predictive general circulation model output, the model quantified the long-term changes in runoff, glacierized area, and cumulative glacier and snow mass balance. The glacier retreat is estimated to continue to 2050, with the magnitude of area decrease and negative cumulative mass balance depending on the increasing temperature trend used. For higher temperature trends, in particular, greater seasonal variation in runoff and larger contributions from subsurface runoff and surface runoff by rainfall were simulated to occur in the wet season, but the change in annual total runoff between the present and 2050 was not significant. These results suggest that it is important to consider how to best adapt to greater seasonal runoff variations in terms of water availability in the downstream region.},

  abstract = {Water resources in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia strongly depend on runoff from mountain catchments in the Cordillera Real, Andes. The balance between the water available from the source catchments and the demand of the cities has become precarious during recent years because of an increasing population and the runoff variability caused by climate change. In this study, a first-order estimate of the future water supply and demand for the El Alto system, the most rapidly growing area in La Paz and El Alto, was obtained for the first time based on a demographic analysis and runoff projection, and effective measures for adapting to water shortage were examined. The water demand in 2036 is expected to increase by 15\textendash 53\% compared to that of 2011, depending on the scenario for the water loss in the supply system and population estimates, while the projected water supply shows frequent reductions because of the climate variability and decreasing glacial meltwater. Thus, the water transfer from a neighboring system (the Achachicala system) will be indispensable to sustain the supply that cannot be covered by releases from Tuni Lake. Nevertheless, the El Alto system will likely face a serious water shortage after the mid-2020s for the most conservative scenario of demand increase, while large uncertainty was found for the balance of supply and demand, depending on the scenarios for population growth, improvement of water loss, and climate variability and trend. For supply side management, the extended diversion of runoff into Tuni Lake, water transfer from the Achachicala system, and transfer of runoff from the Taypichaca catchment will be effective in securing the water supply under various uncertain conditions.},

  abstract = {Understanding how tropical montane catchments store and release water, and the resulting water ecosystem services they provide is crucial for improving water resource management. But while research in high\textendash elevation tropical environments has made progress in defining streamflow generation processes, we still lack fundamental knowledge regarding water storage characteristics of catchments. Here we explore catchment storage and the factors controlling its spatial variability in seven P\'aramo catchments (0.20\textendash 7.53 km2) in southern Ecuador. We applied a field-based approach using hydrometeorological, water stable isotopic, and soils hydrophysical data from a 3 year collection period to estimate the passive (PasS) and dynamic (DynS) storage of the catchments. We also investigated relations between these storages and landscape and hydrometric variables using linear regression analysis. PasS estimates from hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mean transit times were consistent with estimates using streamflow mean transit times. Computed catchment PasS and DynS for the seven watersheds were 313\textendash 617 mm and 29\textendash 35 mm, respectively. PasS increased directly with the areal proportion of Histosol soils and cushion plant vegetation (wetlands). DynS increased linearly with precipitation intensity. Importantly, only 6\textendash 10\% of the mixing storage of the catchments (DynS/PasS) was hydrologically active in their water balance. Wetlands internal to the catchments were important for PasS, where constant input of low intensity precipitation sustained wetlands recharge, and thus, the water regulation capacity (i.e., year\textendash round water supply) of P\'aramo catchments. Our findings provide new insights into the factors controlling the water regulation capacity of P\'aramo catchments and other peaty soils dominated environments.},

This article presents results from two years of transdisciplinary collaborative research evaluating the complex relationships between coupled environmental and social change in the region. First, hydrologie results suggest there has been an average increase of 1.6 ({$\pm$}1.1) percent in the specific discharge of the more glacier-covered catchments ({$>$}20 percent glacier area) as a function of changes in stable isotopes of water ({$\delta^1$}\textphi O and {$\delta^2$}H) from 2004 to 2006. Second, there is a large (mean 60 percent) component of groundwater in dry season discharge based on results from the hydrochemical basin characterization method. Third, findings from extensive key interviews and seventy-two randomly sampled household interviews within communities located in two case study watersheds demonstrate that a large majority of households perceive that glacier recession is proceeding very rapidly and that climate change-related impacts are affecting human vulnerability across multiple shifting vectors including access to water resources, agro-pastoral production, and weather variability. 在秘魯的科迪勒拉布主卡地區，伺候斐化正在專致急劇的冰川物廣損失，造成了旦釣圭塔流域的水文斐化，并增 加了人獎的脆弱性。本文介招了在該地區避行了兩年之久的跨孝科的合作研究成果，以汗份玉不境和社合斐革的之 間的畫余美系。首先，水文結果表明， 2004 到 2006 年，根揖水的稽定向位素 ({$\delta$}0180 和 {$\delta$}2H) 的斐化結果， i亥 地區具有較高冰川覆蓋的蓄水流域區 (大于分之二十的冰川面祺{$\rangle$}戶生了平均增長百分之 1.6 ({$\pm$} 1.1 )的學流 量增長。第二，基于水化學盆地分析方法的結果，存在一小較大的(平均百分之六十)早季流量的地下水体。第 三，本文財位于上述兩小小案流域內的社區避行了尸泛的重為坊淡和瞄机的 72 戶抽祥坊肉，研究結果表明:大部 分的家庭感賞到冰川衰退地非常迅速，勻伺候斐化有夫的影吶非常尸泛，影吶到人癸的脆弱性，包括水質源的利 用，家牧生戶和天是可斐化。是錚錚. 辭去化化 El cambio clim\'atico est\'a causando una dram\'atica p\'erdida de masa en los glaciares de la Cordillera Blanca, Per\'u, generando transformaciones hidrol\'ogicas en toda la cuenca del R\'io Santa e incrementando la vulnerabilidad humana.

  abstract = {Accelerating glacier recession in tropical highlands and in the Peruvian Andes specifically is a manifestation of global climate change that is influencing the hydrologic cycle and impacting water resources across a range of socio-environmental systems. Despite predictions regarding the negative effects of long-term glacier decline on water availability, many uncertainties remain regarding the timing and variability of hydrologic changes and their impacts. To improve context-specific understandings of the effects of climate change and glacial melt on water resources in the tropical Andes, this article synthesizes results from long-term transdisciplinary research with new findings from two glacierized Peruvian watersheds to develop and apply a multi-level conceptual framework focused on the coupled biophysical and social determinants of water access and hydro-social risks in these settings. The framework identifies several interacting variables\textemdash hydrologic transformation, land cover change, perceptions of water availability, water use and infrastructure in local and regional economies, and water rights and governance\textemdash to broadly assess how glacier change is embedded with social risks and vulnerability across diverse water uses and sectors. The primary focus is on the Santa River watershed draining the Cordillera Blanca to the Pacific. Additional analysis of hydrologic change and water access in the geographically distinct Shullcas River watershed draining the Huaytapallana massif towards the city of Huancayo further illuminates the heterogeneous character of hydrologic risk and vulnerability in the Andes.},

  abstract = {Glaciers cover {$\sim$}10\% of the Earth's land surface, but they are shrinking rapidly across most parts of the world, leading to cascading impacts on downstream systems. Glaciers impart unique footprints on river flow at times when other water sources are low. Changes in river hydrology and morphology caused by climate-induced glacier loss are projected to be the greatest of any hydrological system, with major implications for riverine and near-shore marine environments. Here, we synthesize current evidence of how glacier shrinkage will alter hydrological regimes, sediment transport, and biogeochemical and contaminant fluxes from rivers to oceans. This will profoundly influence the natural environment, including many facets of biodiversity, and the ecosystem services that glacier-fed rivers provide to humans, particularly provision of water for agriculture, hydropower, and consumption. We conclude that human society must plan adaptation and mitigation measures for the full breadth of impacts in all affected regions caused by glacier shrinkage.},

  abstract = {Andean headwater catchments are an important source of freshwater for downstream water users. However, few long-term studies exist on the relative importance of climate change and direct anthropogenic perturbations on flow regimes in these catchments. In this paper, we assess change in streamflow based on long time series of hydrometeorological data (1974\textendash 2008) and land cover reconstructions (1963\textendash 2009) in the Pangor catchment (282 km2) located in the tropical Andes. Three main land cover change trajectories can be distinguished during the period 1963\textendash 2009: (1) expansion of agricultural land by an area equal to 14\% of the catchment area (or 39 km2) in 46 years' time, (2) deforestation of native forests by 11 \% (or -31 km2) corresponding to a mean rate of 67 ha yr-1, and (3) afforestation with exotic species in recent years by about 5 \% (or 15 km2). Over the time period 1963\textendash 2009, about 50 \% of the 64 km2 of native forests was cleared and converted to agricultural land. Given the strong temporal variability of precipitation and streamflow data related to El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, we use empirical mode decomposition techniques to detrend the time series. The long-term increasing trend in rainfall is remarkably different from the observed changes in streamflow, which exhibit a decreasing trend. Hence, observed changes in streamflow are not the result of long-term change in precipitation but very likely result from anthropogenic disturbances associated with land cover change.},

  abstract = {Tropical alpine grasslands of the northern Andes, commonly known as the p\'aramo, provide abundant high-quality water for downstream populations as well as a variety of other environmental services. Yet, very little is known about the role that landscape characteristics play in the hydrologic functioning of these ecosystems. To help fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the relationships between various landscape attributes and hydrology in a wet p\'aramo ecosystem of southern Ecuador. Using linear regression analysis, we examined the influence of soil type, vegetation cover, catchment area, geology, and topography on runoff coefficient, streamflow rates, and evapotranspiration. Our study site is located at the Zhurucay River experimental catchment, which is composed of seven nested microcatchments ranging in size from 0.20 to 7.53km2 and in elevation from 3200 to 3900ma.s.l. We found that (1) water yield accounts for a high percentage of the water budget; (2) runoff coefficient and specific discharge are strongly correlated with the extent of Andean p\'aramo wetlands (Histosol soils and cushion plants), and also increase with catchment size; (3) conversely, inferred evapotranspiration is the highest in catchments having the greatest percentages of upland terrain (Andosol soils and tussock grasses); and (4) low flows are highly positively correlated with steep slopes. These results suggest that in the high-elevation tropical grasslands of the Andes, runoff coefficient and specific discharge increase with catchment size because as catchment size increases, so does the relative area of permanently near-saturation zones (Andean p\'aramo wetlands); likely because of reduced available storage capacity of the Andean p\'aramo wetlands, and their hydrologic connectivity to the stream network.},

  abstract = {Methods: Using species trait data, the maximum dispersal distance of 435 species was calculated. Species distribution models (SDM) were fitted to obtain current and future distribution predictions based on dispersal and bioclimatic factors. The final current assemblages and those for 2100 were achieved by stacking all probabilistic SDMs and applying the probability ranking rule. The vulnerability of each sky island was evaluated by quantifying richness and composition changes. Results: Maximum dispersal distances ranged between 0.008 m/year and 6,027 m/ year, and across all scenarios, 70\% of models showed a net loss in species distribution, while 9\% of all species were predicted to undergo extinction in Ecuador by 2100. Local richness was estimated to decrease by 56.63\% on average, and compositional changes in each sky island suggested a mean loss of 64.74\% of their original species pool against a 12.97\% gain. Finally, 5\% of the sky island floras reconverted from high-elevation to low-elevation species. These numbers were usually more important for high-elevation species and the mountains Pichincha, Ilinizas and Antisana. Conclusions: This methodological pioneer study provides novel insight into the future of p\'aramo biodiversity. Significant losses in species distribution and changes in community richness and composition suggest drastic impacts and call for further research considering additional factors, such as land use. Finally, we recommend focusing monitoring and conservation strategies on the northern Ecuadorian sky islands as a priority.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The aim of this paper is to provide the community with a comprehensive overview of the studies of glaciers in the tropical Andes conducted in recent decades leading to the current status of the glaciers in the context of climate change. In terms of changes in surface area and length, we show that the glacier retreat in the tropical Andes over the last three decades is unprecedented since the maximum extension of the Little Ice Age (LIA, mid-17th\textendash early 18th century). In terms of changes in mass balance, although there have been some sporadic gains on several glaciers, we show that the trend has been quite negative over the past 50 yr, with a mean mass balance deficit for glaciers in the tropical Andes that is slightly more negative than the one computed on a global scale. A break point in the trend appeared in the late 1970s with mean annual mass balance per year decreasing from -0.2 m w.e. in the period 1964\textendash 1975 to -0.76 m w.e. in the period 1976\textendash 2010. In addition, even if glaciers are currently retreating everywhere in the tropical Andes, it should be noted that this is much more pronounced on small glaciers at low altitudes that do not have a permanent accumulation zone, and which could disappear in the coming years/decades. Monthly mass balance measurements performed in Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia show that variability of the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean is the main factor governing variability of the mass balance at the decadal timescale. Precipitation did not display a significant trend in the tropical Andes in the 20th century, and consequently cannot explain the glacier recession. On the other hand, temperature increased at a significant rate of 0.10 \textdegree C decade-1 in the last 70 yr. The higher frequency of El Ni\~no events and changes in its spatial and temporal occurrence since the late 1970s together with a warming troposphere over the tropical Andes may thus explain much of the recent dramatic shrinkage of glaciers in this part of the world.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Glaciers in tropical regions are very sensitive to climatic variations and thus strongly affected by climate change. The majority of the tropical glaciers worldwide are located in the Peruvian Andes, which have shown significant ice loss in the last century. Here, we present the first multi-temporal, region-wide survey of geodetic mass balances and glacier area fluctuations throughout Peru covering the period 2000\textendash 2016. Glacier extents are derived from Landsat imagery by performing automatic glacier delineation based on a combination of the NDSI and band ratio method and final manual inspection and correction. The mapping of debris-covered glacier extents is supported by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence information. A total glacier area loss of -548.5{$\pm$}65.7\,km2 (-29\,\%, -34.3\,km2\,a-1) is obtained for the study period. Using interferometric satellite SAR acquisitions, bi-temporal geodetic mass balances are derived. An average specific mass balance of -296{$\pm$}41\,kg\,m-2\,a-1 is found throughout Peru for the period 2000\textendash 2016. However, there are strong regional and temporal differences in the mass budgets ranging from 45{$\pm$}97 to -752{$\pm$}452\,kg\,m-2\,a-1. The ice loss increased towards the end of the observation period. Between 2013 and 2016, a retreat of the glacierized area of -203.8{$\pm$}65.7\,km2 (-16\,\%, -101.9\,km2\,a-1) is mapped and the average mass budget amounts to -660{$\pm$}178\,kg\,m-2\,a-1. The glacier changes revealed can be attributed to changes in the climatic settings in the study region, derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis data and the Oceanic Nino Index. The intense El Ni\~no activities in 2015/16 are most likely the trigger for the increased change rates in the time interval 2013\textendash 2016. Our observations provide fundamental information on the current dramatic glacier changes for local authorities and for the calibration and validation of glacier change projections.},

Uncertainties in our estimation are related to the assumed constant precipitation ({$\sim$}0.5\% for ice-free areas and up to 6.5\% for glaciated areas), the constant runoff coefficient ({$\sim$}1\%), the surface areas of the glaciers and catchments ({$\sim$}5\%) and the mean mass-balance uncertainty of the 21 glaciers used to obtain the mass balance of the 70 glaciers (12\% of the total discharge). Despite the loss of 50\% of the glacierized area during the study period, runoff at La Paz did not change significantly, showing that increase in ice melt rates compensated for reduction in the surface area of the glaciers. In the future, assuming complete disappearance of the glaciers and no change in precipitation, runoff should diminish by {$\sim$}12\% at an annual scale, 9\% during the wet season and 24\% during the dry season.},

  abstract = {In places with high spatiotemporal rainfall variability, such as mountain regions, input data could be a large source of uncertainty in hydrological modeling. Here we evaluate the impact of rainfall estimation on runoff modeling in a small p\'aramo catchment located in the Zhurucay Ecohydrological Observatory (7.53 km2) in the Ecuadorian Andes, using a network of 12 rain gauges. First, the HBV-light semidistributed model was analyzed in order to select the best model structure to represent the observed runoff and its subflow components. Then, we developed six rainfall monitoring scenarios to evaluate the impact of spatial rainfall estimation in model performance and parameters. Finally, we explored how a model calibrated with far-from-perfect rainfall estimation would perform using new improved rainfall data. Results show that while all model structures were able to represent the overall runoff, the standard model structure outperformed the others for simulating subflow components. Model performance (NSeff) was improved by increasing the quality of spatial rainfall estimation from 0.31 to 0.80 and from 0.14 to 0.73 for calibration and validation period, respectively. Finally, improved rainfall data enhanced the runoff simulation from a model calibrated with scarce rainfall data (NSeff 0.14) from 0.49 to 0.60. These results confirm that in mountain regions model uncertainty is highly related to spatial rainfall and, therefore, to the number and location of rain gauges.},

  abstract = {Human influence and its impacts are perceptible in all ecosystems resulting in land transformation, changes in global biogeochemistry, climate change, and loss of biological diversity. Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of human influence is essential to address land use management and conservation programs. In this study, we tailored the Human Footprint index (HF) developed at global level to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of human pressure in South Ecuador for 1982, 1990 and 2008. Landscape and ecosystem levels were analyzed to identify the contribution of different human proxies to the HF. We also used the HF to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas to reduce human pressure in the surrounding landscape. We found that levels of human pressure increased and the wildest areas decreased since 1982. We identified important ``hotspots of changes'' in the seasonally dry forests in the western part and the premontane evergreen forest in the eastern part of the study area. Our results show that each human proxy contributes in a different way to the observed values of HF in the studied ecosystems. Finally, we found that Podocarpus NP, the most important protected area in our study region, seems to be partially effective in reducing human pressure inside and in the buffer zones where only a low increase in HF was detected. However, the HF values observed in the surrounding landscape were higher than those observed in the buffer zone and inside the protected area. We demonstrated that HF could be a useful regional evaluation tool to facilitate conservation planning.},

  abstract = {We examined the storage dynamics and isotopic composition of soil water over 12 months in three hydropedological units in order to understand runoff generation in a montane catchment. The units form classic catena sequences from freely draining podzols on steep upper hillslopes through peaty gleys in shallower lower slopes to deeper peats in the riparian zone. The peaty gleys and peats remained saturated throughout the year, while the podzols showed distinct wetting and drying cycles. In this region, most precipitation events are {$<$}10 mm in magnitude, and storm runoff is mainly generated from the peats and peaty gleys, with runoff coefficients (RCs) typically {$<$}10\%. In larger events the podzolic soils become strongly connected to the saturated areas, and RCs can exceed 40\%. Isotopic variations in precipitation are significantly damped in the organic-rich soil surface horizons due to mixing with larger volumes of stored water. This damping is accentuated in the deeper soil profile and groundwater. Consequently, the isotopic composition of stream water is also damped, but the dynamics strongly reflect those of the near-surface waters in the riparian peats. ``pre-event'' water typically accounts for {$>$}80\% of flow, even in large events, reflecting the displacement of water from the riparian soils that has been stored in the catchment for {$>$}2 years. These riparian areas are the key zone where different source waters mix. Our study is novel in showing that they act as ``isostats,'' not only regulating the isotopic composition of stream water, but also integrating the transit time distribution for the catchment.},

  abstract = {Alpine glaciers in the low- and mid-latitudes respond more quickly than large polar ice sheets to changes in temperature, precipitation, cloudiness, humidity, and radiation. Many high-altitude glaciers are monitored by ground observations, aerial photography, and satellite-borne sensors. Regardless of latitude and elevation, nearly all nonpolar glaciers and ice caps are undergoing mass loss, which compromises the records of past climate preserved within them. Almost without exception, the retreat of these ice fields is persistent, and a very important driver is the recent warming of the tropical troposphere and oceans. Here we present data on the decrease in the surface area of four glaciers from low- to mid-latitude mountainous regions: the Andes of Peru and northern Bolivia, equatorial east Africa, equatorial Papua, Indonesia, and the western Tibetan Plateau. Climate records based on oxygen isotopic ratios ({$\delta$}18O) measured in ice cores drilled from several glaciers in these regions reveal that the records from elevations below \textasciitilde 6000 m above sea level have been substantially modified by seasonal melting and the movement of meltwater through porous upper firn layers. Fortunately, {$\delta$}18O records recovered from higher altitude sites still contain well-preserved seasonal variations to the surface; however, the projected increase in the rate of atmospheric warming implies that climate records from higher elevation glaciers will eventually also be degraded. A long-term ice core collection program on the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru, Earth's largest tropical ice cap, illustrates that the deterioration of its climate record is concomitant with the increase in mid-troposphere temperatures. The melting ice and resulting growth of proglacial lakes presents an imminent hazard to nearby communities. The accelerating melting of glaciers, if sustained, ensures the eventual loss of unique and irreplaceable climate histories, as well as profound economic, agricultural, and cultural im\- pacts on local communities.},

  abstract = {Glaciers in the tropical Andes have been retreating for the past several decades, leading to a temporary increase in dry season water supply downstream. Projected future glacier shrinkage, however, will lead to a long-term reduction in dry season river discharge from glacierized catchments. This glacier retreat is closely related to the observed increase in high-elevation, surface air temperature in the region. Future projections using a simple freezing level height- equilibrium-line altitude scaling approach suggest that glaciers in the inner tropics, such as Antizana in Ecuador, may be most vulnerable to future warming while glaciers in the more arid outer tropics, such as Zongo in Bolivia, may persist, albeit in a smaller size, throughout the 21st century regardless of emission scenario. Nonetheless many uncertainties persist, most notably problems with accurate snowfall measurements in the glacier accumulation zone, uncertainties in establishing accurate thickness measurements on glaciers, unknown future changes associated with local-scale circulation and cloud cover affecting glacier energy balance, the role of aerosols and in particular black carbon deposition on Andean glaciers, and the role of groundwater and aquifers interacting with glacier meltwater.},

  abstract = {Tussock grass p\'aramo constitutes the dominant vegetation of the high tropical Andes and cordilleras of Costa Rica. Its distribution, composition and the location of the upper forest line are ascribed, by broad consensus, to climate. The zonal argument finds support in the altitudinal movements of p\'aramo during the Pleistocene, clearly responding to changes in precipitation and temperature. I ask here, however, if the principal ecological variables driving post-Pleistocene p\'aramos are circumscribed solely by climate. The combined pollen, charcoal and archaeological evidence generated in recent decades suggests a distinct Holocene etiology. Five principal conclusions emerge: (1) the sedimentary charcoal record establishes that grass p\'aramo is a fired landscape, (2) natural sources of fire, specifically volcanoes and lightning, are incapable of generating the fire regime apparent in the sedimentary charcoal record, (3) burning at most sites intensified significantly between 13,000 and 11,000 cal. yr BP, and maintained heightened levels during the Holocene, (4) archaeological findings suggest that the original settlement of the Andes coincided with the sedimentary charcoal rise, and (5) the subsistence logic of hunter-gatherers argues strongly for firing the vegetation to increase resource productivity and reliability. From the pioneering mixed vegetation after deglaciation, anthropic fire selected in favor of tussocks and against woody species, generating a novel plant association. I propose, therefore, that Holocene grass p\'aramo is not zonal vegetation, but rather a hunter-gatherer landscape.},
